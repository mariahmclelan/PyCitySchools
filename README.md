# pandas-challenge
Analaysis of district-wide standardized test results data. Incluidng school type, school spending, and school size.

Using pandas I created new dataframes from the csv files and organized the results. I have a districts summary and a school summary. I was able to locate the highest and lowest performing schools by percentage of overall passing. I separated the math and r4eading scores by grade level. Finally I sorted the scores by school,size, school funding, and school type.

Using this information I was able to write a report of myt findings.
